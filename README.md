# D20-Rolls
RolePlaying software
a classic D20 RPG system, mutated into a PC game, where you crawl through the dungeon in a turn-based dice roller. its NOT like anything else you've played, it allows you to fit the dungeon together as you go,

Now has an advanced combat system, dragons and monsters, also points can be spent but not rearranged.

skills included in the game are; acrobatics,stealth,spellcraft,use magic,heal,combat,swim,Perception,disable traps,survival,handle animals,escape artist,Bluff,and search. its heavily based on tabletop type rpgs.

its free for the PC & Mac , new version, has been tweeked, for deeper exploration, the old version leveled-up to quick, I also have put a cap on combat skill points. Combat is has a higher difficulty Class. I also added a intel MacOSX version.

now has is tablet friendly, for the full windows tablets NOT windows RT. works on the microsoft surface , just left clicks.
